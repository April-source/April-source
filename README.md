- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maya-source
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the ins and outs of coding, as well as video games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of coding. I wrote my first successful script not too long ago!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on generic coding projects. I'm still very new to this, so my knowledge is limited; however I am willing to learn and to try!
- 📫 How to reach me: TBD
